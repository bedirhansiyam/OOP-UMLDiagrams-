# Elevator Simulation - UML Diagram
<p>Kodluyoruz Insurance Company wants to build an office building with 12 floors and equip it with the latest elevator technology. The company wants to develop a software that shows whether these elevators will meet the need. </p>
<p>The building will have five elevators, each of them can go to the 12 floors of the building. The capacity of each elevator is six people. Elevators are designed to be energy efficient, so they only move when needed. Each elevator has its own door, control panel and indicator light. The control panel has floor buttons, door open/close buttons, and an emergency signal button. </p>
<p>The building has a total of five elevator shafts. There are five doors, bells and signal lights on each floor. The bell rings that the elevators have reached the floor. Signal light indicates that the elevator is coming and the direction of movement of the elevator. Each floor also has three sets of elevator call buttons. </p>
<p>Anyone calls an elevator by pressing the call button (up or down). A controller assigns one of the five elevators to go to the floor where the call is made. While the elevator is moving, an indicator light inside the elevator informs passengers of the elevator's floor. When the elevator reaches the target floor, the signal lamp turns on and the bell rings on the floor. When an elevator stops on a floor, both doors open automatically for a predetermined time, allowing passengers to enter and exit the elevator. </p>
<p> A random number generator determines the number of people and floors on and off for each person. The simulator uses a "timer" to timestamp and log events that occur in the simulation.</p>
